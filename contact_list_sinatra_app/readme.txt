This is a small contact list Sinatra app. You can create a profile and add contacts to your contact list. You can edit a contact and also delete a contact from the contact list. 
Each user is stored in a YAML file. It contains the username, password and the contacts of that user.
Each contact field send by the add and edit form will be checked for errors. An error message is shown when we enter wrong input.
